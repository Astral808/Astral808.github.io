		<h2>Recommended Links for further Weathering!
		<ul class="weatherlinks"> <!-- Contains clickable titles, which open up on a new tab -->
			<li><a href="https://www.windy.com" target="blank">Windy</a>
				<p>A great site that I use for a quick satellite or radar shot of any place on Earth! Also contains many other layers for viewing, such as wind!</p>
			<li><a href="https://www.weather.cod.edu" target="blank">College of Dupage - Meteorology</a>
				<p>For more in-depth radar viewing, or very localized model viewing, CoD's Meteorology website is my go to.</p>
			<li><a href="https://www.cyclocane.com" target="blank">Cyclocane</a>
				<p>More specific for hurricane/typhoon season, this site is my go to for viewing potential, or even current hurricane/typhoon developments around the world.</p>
			<li><a href="https://www.aviationweather.gov/metar" target="blank">Aviation Weather Center</a>
				<p>I don't use this too often, but if you are interested in seeing past, and current hourly observations and forecasts for different parts of the world, this is a good source.</p>
			<li><a href="https://www.weather.gov" target="blank">National Weather Service<a/>
				<p>Last be not least, the National Weather Service. There are so many different topics and information that you could find in this website, it would take me forever just to list it down. For the real weather go-getters, this is a must!
