		<p class="intro">Hello everyone! This is my first website, and <em><b>I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, but somehow its working!</b></em> To start it off, I am James Sarol, and I am a weather forecaster for the United States Air Force. 
		I have been in the Air Force a couple years, and I am nearing the end of my enlistment. I'm still not sure what I want to do, but I have been leaning towards re-enlisting. As much as others like to say how fun it might be to be in weather, 
		it is a lot of computer watching, and not much "go look outside the window" action.</p> 
		<p class="intro">However, enough about my job. Some of hobbies include gaming, listening to music, and watching videos on YouTube. Games I like to play usually fall under the Grand-Strategy genre; games such as Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron. 
		Because of my upbringing of being in band during my school days, I think I have learned to enjoy all types of music; whether it be metal, jazz, rock, or even songs like K-POP and J-POP.
		All the different types of people I met in the band community really exposed me to a lot of music! As for YouTube videos, it has mostly been videos related to the games I play, but with this course, I can already see my recommended videos slowly changing towards a different topic....
