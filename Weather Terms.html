			<li>Cold Front
				<p class="weatherdefinitions">A colder air mass <span style="font-size:70%">(usually coming from the north for the Northern Hemisphere)</span> moves into a warmer air mass.</p>
			<li>Warm Front	
				<p class="weatherdefinitions">The opposite of a Cold front, it is when a warm air mass <span style="font-size:70%">(usually coming from the south for the Northern Hemisphere)</span> moves into a colder <span style="padding-left:75px">air mass.</span></p>
			<li>Inversion
				<p class="weatherdefinitions">It is a layer in the atmosphere where temperature increases with height. When it is seen at the surface, this acts as a <span style="padding-left:75px">cap against colder, faster air from reaching the surface.</span></p>
			<li>Thunderstorms
				<p class="weatherdefinitions">This is characterized as a storm that includes the presence of lightning. Depending on the severity, it may bring heavy <span style="padding-left:75px">rain and even hail!</span></p>
			<li>Showery Precipitation
				<p class="weatherdefinitions">Showery precipitation is not that different from regular precipitation, but the term showery is what makes it special. <span style="padding-left:75px">Showery means that the precipitation begins and ends suddenly, and may occur multiple times!</span></p>
